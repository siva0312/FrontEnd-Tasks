    <h3>Motorcycle Excellence - Embracing the Road</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our brand is synonymous with motorcycles that embody the epitome of excellence and riding pleasure.

        This excellence is showcased through our iconic models like the Lightning Cruiser, setting new standards with each generation.

        Founded by passionate riders John Rider and Jane Speedster, our journey began in 1990 with a shared vision to create not just good, but exceptional motorcycles.

        In this spotlight, we'll delve into our story and the bikes that exemplify our principles, continuing to redefine the world of motorcycling.

    <span className='hov'><h3>When Passion Meets Engineering</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;John Rider's fascination with Jane Speedster's custom bike ignited a spark. His determination to create motorcycles that thrill led to the birth of our brand.

        Captivated by the idea, they embarked on a journey to craft unique bikes with the heart of a rider and the soul of an engineer.

        Our company emerged as a result of their partnership and unyielding passion for motorcycles.

        Mark Steel, a visionary in our journey, played a crucial role by crafting our identity, inventing slogans like "Not just a ride, but a journey itself".

        It didn't take long before we turned this vision into reality.

    <span className='hov'><h3>Bikes - Breaking Barriers</h3>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1995, we marked the beginning of an era, establishing a new benchmark for performance and style with the Lightning Cruiser.

        This motorcycle shattered boundaries when it completed a coast-to-coast journey 25 times, covering an astounding 18,500 miles!

        With over 10,000 units sold, the Lightning Cruiser became a legend. As we introduced the Blaze Rider, the next evolution of our legacy, we continued to redefine what a motorcycle could be.

        Our journey had only just begun.
