                      This season begins in March and lasts until May. The temperatures are high, ranging between 35°C and 40°C and so is the humidity especially in the coastal regions. Sightseeing during this time is not very convenient because of the improper temperature. The season, however, is visited to witness the festival of Chithirai held in the Madurai temple in the month of March-April. Puthandu, another important festival that marks the Tamil New year falls in mid-April and Mahamahan Festival is celebrated in March (celebrated once in 12 years). If visiting during summer, it is a good idea to visit the attractions on higher attitudes. Hill stations like Ooty, Kodaikanal and Yelagiri hills are the best where the temperature is pleasant and has scenic views that tourists can witness.

                    This southern state sees monsoon two times a year - once between June to September and the retreating monsoon in November and December. The temperature is slightly less than what it is in the summer season. It ranges between 25°C and 30°C. The rains often occur in long spells and the humidity during this time is high especially in coastal regions. Some of the hilly areas see massive rainfall and venturing out during this time around is not a great idea. The Eastern seaboard of Tamil Nadu sometimes experiences cyclones during the late monsoon, making it an unsafe place to visit.

                    Winter in Tamil Nadu begins in October and lasts until February. November and December have intermittent rainfall because of the retreating monsoon, but otherwise, the temperature remains between 10°C and 15°C. The humidity is low, and it is the best climate for sightseeing and touring the cities. Most of the tourist attractions are bustling with activities during this season. The beaches call the beach lovers, and adventure seekers for bathing in the sun, swimming and water sports as the temperature remains moderate all through the day.

            The best time to visit Tamil Nadu is during the winter season, i.e., from November to February when the temperature is relatively low, and pleasant to explore the attractions in the state. Monsoons bring torrential downpour which makes it an inappropriate time to travel through Tamil Nadu, Summer, however, is perfect for exploring the hills stations. Tourists can pick the region they wish to see according to the season because offseason visits could be extremely inconvenient for some.

            October to February during the winters and the pre-monsoons season is the best time to visit Chennai. This time of the year is considered as the best time to explore the metropolitan city as summers are scorching and monsoons bring torrential downpours and cyclones. Its geographical location on the beautiful coastline mostly keeps the city's weather hot and humid.

            Chennai is one of the cities that has successfully blended the modern, traditional and sides with ease. The city welcomes everyone who wants to seek a soulful and spiritual connection but also those who love shopping for sarees and enjoy good food. There is no conundrum in Chennai when you visit. It's all about the moment, whether you decide to take a stroll down Marina Beach.

                  Winters, the best time to visit Chennai, begin in November and last till February. Even the transitional month of October is quite good for exploring the city. The weather is quite pleasant with the maximum temperature hovering around 30°C and the minimum around 22°C. Its proximity to the coastline also results in occasional rains, but it will not be something that will hamper travel plans to a great extent. Kapaleeshwarar temple, Government Museum, Fort St George, St. Andrews Church, Fort Museum, Nalli Silks, Kalakshetra Foundation, Vivekananda House etc. are some of the attractions that can be seen when in Chennai. The season is also famous for the array of festivals organized in the city like the Dance and Music Festival in December, Travel & Tourism Fair and Pongal in January and the Natyanjali Dance Festival held in February/ March. These events are traditional and important celebrations of Chennai and its culture and must not be missed when there.

                  March marks the onset of the summer season in Chennai. It lasts till June and visiting the city during this time is not for the faint- hearted, some say. The days are blazing hot with the temperatures soaring as high as 39°C and the nights are equally warm with the minimum hovering around 27°C. Exploring the cityscape during this time of the year is an extremely exhausting affair and is, therefore, not advised to tourists.

                  Chennai is susceptible to heavy downpours and cyclones between the months of July and September. These months mark the monsoon season in the region and is considered off-season as tourism does not really thrive here. The extreme rainfalls and strong winds could prove to be a hindrance to sightseeing and, therefore, the monsoon season is not recommended to tourists. The hotel tariffs, however, drop drastically during the season, making it a decent option for budget travelers. In case one must visit Chennai, they may want to plan a trip at the onset of the season when the showers are moderate and allow travelling through the city.

                  Winters in Rameshwaram, which last from October all the way to March, is said to be the peak season for visiting Rameshwaram if you are visiting the place as a tourist and not a pilgrim. The temperature during these months drops considerably than the other two seasons, with it ranging from 20 degree Celsius to 30-degree Celsius. The town is also blessed with chilly winds which make the atmosphere even more amicable. This season, therefore, makes for the best time for tourists to take part in a plethora of outdoor activities and enjoy their stay. During December, Rameshwaram also hosts the festival of Arudhra Darshanam which is essentially a festival that celebrates an aspect of Lord Shiva. This is said to be one of the most celebrated festivals amongst all the ones celebrated in Rameshwaram.

Summers are also called the pilgrim season in Rameshwaram, meaning the town may be exceptionally crowded with chances of various processions and chants throughout the area. The climate in the summers stays hot, as is usual for most Tamil Nadu towns, with the afternoons Being exceptionally sunny. However, the rest of the day is said to clear up, and the heat may not bother you as much.

While adventure enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies’ throng Hogenakkal in the monsoon, it is not recommended for tourists as the currents are too strong to swim in. Boating is not allowed either, or there is no standard means of transportation to reach the waterfalls. It is best to avoid the river, as the water flow may be too heavy. Further downhill, you can go rafting if you prefer, although discretion is advised. The waterfalls are a sight to behold, as they live up to their name of the 'Smoking Rocks - the sultry mist as the water strikes the rocks covers the base in a myriad of colors. Rainbows adorn the falls, and the scene is postcard perfect.

            Hogenakkal Falls, located on the border of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, is one of the most scenic places to visit in the region. The waterfall is known as Hogenakkal, or "Smoky Rocks", because of the unique arrangement of the gigantic, carbonated rocks that surround it. The sight of River Kaveri splitting into multiple small streams and cascading from different heights ranging from 15 feet to 66 feet will leave you mesmerized! Hogenakkal Waterfall is like the popular.
